              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>I am currently working for Make It Brain, a design agency in Nantes as a UI / UX designer. 
                I work for a multitude of clients in very different industries such as real estate, media, energy, transport, and many more. 
                Previously, I worked as an ergonomist and I worked on the design and update of business interfaces based on user interviews. 
                I also helped one of France's biggest banks to structure and deploy a new culture based on their users.
                I will graduate from ECV Digital Nantes in June 2021 with a degree in UX/UI design. 
                This moment in school allowed me to create and test methods and concepts that made me grow as a designer. 
                I am eager to use these methods in the project I will work on, as well as keeping that "test and learn" state of mind, who knows where this can take a project.</p>
