                NatureWise allows citizens to learn about pollution and its numerous effects on human health. 
                They can use what they know to report local pollution triggers and build a map of local pollutions used by cities to have a better outlook on the situation of their area and compare themselves to other places in the world. 
                Cities can ask for more data with the built-in survey feature to ask a qualified audience about their local environment. 
                Finally, making simulations to predict different outcomes or to yield city-wide actions can be done directly from the platform.

                The problem
              </h2>
              <p>
              I always wanted to work on a subject linked to cities, no matter in what field that would be, as long as I get to work on large issues cities would have, I would be happy. 
              For my thesis, I knew I wanted to design a product that would help cities. 
              The research I did gave me a more precise idea of what was important for citizens, I will detail the outcomes further down.

                UX Research
              </h2>
              <p>
              I posted an online survey on LinkedIn, Twitter, and groups on Facebook and Reddit dedicated for students to share their surveys (I thought it would be a great way to get feedback from people that are not in my circles or country). 
              I got a total of 100 responses spread across 13 countries and 4 continents (with a large predominance of Europe). 
              The main insights I got from this survey are the following:
              
              <ul>
                <li>Environmental issues (and environment-related topics such as nature, pollution, cleanliness) represent 33% of responses.</li>
                <li>71% of respondants want to help their city in any way possible...</li>
                <li>... but only 20% of them are helping their city by taking part in associations or volunteer work.</li>
              </ul>

              I also got some verbatims to help me design the 2 strategies I would follow to design my product. 
              These are the backbone of the product I am trying to build, they drive the purpose of the service, the features, and even the brand identity of the product.
              
              <ol>
                <li>Enable residents to learn about pollution and its effects on health and the environment and create synergies between citizens and metropolitan governments</li>
                <li>Make the fight against pollution and its effects on populations a tool for piloting the city's environmental actions</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                  This project can be split into two, first, there is the work directly linked to my thesis. 
                  I detailed the steps I went through to create a product (research, definition, ideation, prototype, test) and conclude with the next steps one could take to bring their product beyond. 
                  The second part of this project is the actual design of NatureWise (fill out the business model and value proposition canvas, do competition research, set up the brand and its guidelines, make wireframes and then design the MVP, run the test sessions).

                Journey

              <p>
              NatureWise speaks to citizens and institutions (such as cities, NGOs, or companies) and I made 4 personas to represent these potential targets.
              I also mapped out their ideal journey across the app, from the login process to the change of their profile picture and the app settings. You can take a look at the (extensive) map down below.

                User Interface Design
              </h2>
              <p>
              I chose a mobile-first approach knowing NatureWise would be primarily used by citizens on phones. 
              I sketched out all the screens I needed on one specific journey (from the sign-up process to the profile page). 
              Each time, I identified what design components I would need (like a form, a button...) to have a global idea of the component library I would have to create.
              Additionally, I also spotted some core actions that a user could perform on a smartwatch (to realize a quick action like report something on the map or check their surrounding's pollution levels for instance).
              I also worked on the tablet version for my "Institution Personas" on one journey, you can have a sneak peek of it on the video below.
